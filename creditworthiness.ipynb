    "A bank wants to predict the creditworthiness of its customers. Based on the customer records, the credit history, etc., a customer should be classified as creditworthy or unworthy of credit. It is five times more 'expensive' for the bank to rate a customer who is unworthy of credit as creditworthy than vice versa. In addition, not all information is available for all customers. For 1,000 representatively selected customers, the creditworthiness is known. For these customers the following data has been collected. (Features for which not all values are known are marked with the addition \"incomplete\".)"

Therefore we create new features for our data like that: A30=0, A31=0, A32=1, A33=0, A34=0 (for the \"Credit history\" of the client being A32).

Taking a closer look at the data we can aswell see that the attribute \"Telephone\" only has two possible values (A191 and A192), which means we don't need to create a vector for it, but can transform the data to a binary code within the column (place a 0 for A191 and a 1 for A192).
